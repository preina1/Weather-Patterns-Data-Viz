# Weather-Patterns-Data-Viz
A data visualization of extreme weather patterns using Matplotlib

This data visualization was created as part of the course requirements for the applied plotting with Python course by the University of Michigan on Coursera. A data subset from The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Daily Global Historical Climatology Network was provided for this assignment. The dataset consisted of daily maximum and minimum temperatures (in tenths of degrees C) recorded near Ann Arbor, MI. The task was to create a line plot of the maximum and minimum temperatures recorded over the period 2014-2015 overlaid by the record high and low temperatures that broke the ten year record in 2015.

Data was processed and filtered using Pandas and the data visualization was created using Matplotlib. The plot can be found in the Jupyter Notebook of this repository. The plot clearly shows a sizable number of 2015 data points, indicating many high and low temperatures breaking the 2005-2014 ten year record and suggesting that temperatures are becoming more extreme.

This repository includes the present README file and the Jupyter Notebook that includes the code and results for this analysis.
